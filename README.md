### Howdy there!

Iâ€™m a software architect. Currently, I'm working as a software architect at PrepayPower. Iâ€™ve studied computer network engineering and am interested in software architecture, especially cloud architecture. On my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, travelling and play tennis.Â
